<p>You have finally browsed into our 'online museum for your mind.' We are happy to have you!</p>
<H1>WHAT IS THIS PAGE?</H1>
<p>Greetings O Great Soul is an online hub for information and forum (members only) for people wishing to live a more fulfilling life. The appRoach of the 21st century has caused a big shift in how we should approach topics like sleep, community, free will, nutriotion (of body and mind.) and so much more! As such; Greetings 0 Great Soul wishes to combine ancient wisdom that has evolved us from jungles to concrete streets. Instead of announcing news from a physical 'forum', it is more with the times to do so on an online 'forum'! Blessed that it may be!</p>
<H1>WHAT ARE YOUR 6 CORE BELIEFS?</H1>
    <p>- Hapiness is within everybody.</p>
     <p>- Most philosophies do not account for modern technology. only we do.</p>
     <p>-Words on the internet are magic, for they can reach anybody.</p>
    <img src="Assets/universe.png" width="240">
    <p>-We are not in control.</p>
    <p>-Every desire, food, money, love, safety, is a desire for control.</p>
    <p>-If you really want something. Multiply that desire by 10.</p>
<H1>HOW DO I JOIN IN ON THE CONVERSATION?</H1>
    <p>It is good that you are willing to converse with like-minded individuals. To keep our talks from being overloading with SPAM and other nonsense we have a lock on the forum. </p>
   <input id="numb">
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">This is my colour.</button>
    <p id="demo"></p>
     <p>If you wish to converse, input the correct colour to continue. Write it in the code of curses.</p>
   
   
   
<script>
function myFunction() {
  // Get the value of the input field with id="numb"
  let x = document.getElementById("numb").value;
  // If x is Not a Number or less than one or greater than 10
  let text;
  if (x = "#d2003b") {
    text = "You have found it, wonderfull, now your last objective is to put the reward where 'index' once was."
  } else {
    text = "The answer is wrong. Remember that colour exists on the internet in many ways and languages.";
  }
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
}
